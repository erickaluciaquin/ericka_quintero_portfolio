My name is Ericka Quintero, and I’m a junior at California State University, Monterey Bay, majoring in Marine Science with a minor in Data Science. I was born in El Centro, California, and raised in a family of six in Mexicali, Mexico. Growing up near the United States-Mexico border has made me fluent in both English and Spanish. I’m a highly motivated and creative person who enjoys practicing yoga and barre, but I’m most often found at home baking banana cookies."

Her academic journey began at Saint Mary’s College in Notre Dame, Indiana, before she transferred to CSUMB to further explore her passion for oceanic studies and data analysis.\nIn 2022, Ericka gained hands-on experience in childhood education and coastal monitoring as a camp counselor at YMCA Camp Surf. Driven by her deep love for animals, she dedicated an entire summer to volunteering at Vet Point Vet Hospital in her hometown of Mexicali, Mexico—an invaluable opportunity to immerse herself in the veterinary field.\nThis year, she continues her commitment to youth education and outdoor learning by returning to YMCA at Camp Campbell, where she looks forward to expanding her skills and experiences."
