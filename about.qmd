Hello! My name is Ericka Quintero, and I’m a junior at California State University, Monterey Bay, majoring in Marine Science with a minor in Data Science. I was born in El Centro, California, and raised in a family of six in Mexicali, Mexico. Growing up near the United States-Mexico border has made me fluent in both English and Spanish. I’m a highly motivated and creative person who enjoys practicing yoga and barre, but I’m most often found at home baking banana cookies.
